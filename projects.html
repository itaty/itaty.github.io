		        	can answer all the 5 questions correctly, the win screen will appear meaning you have won the game. If 
		        	you click on the screen, it will take you back to start screen. If you click on the about button, it

		        	<p class="p-text">While making the android app project, there were many difficulties encountered 
		        	especially with being new to coding. Making a quiz app could have been easy by just making a different 
		        	screen for each question and going to the next screen for choosing the correct answer etc., but 
		        	that amount of screens would crash the game. Making it more intricate by mixing up the choices 
		        	was a real challenge. The first step to figuring out how to change up the options was to learn 
		        	how to use lists. First we put the choices in the list and used the select random integer function 
		        	as for each index of each option. Then, so the choices would not repeat, a “remove list item” character 
		        	was needed. Once we figured out how to do that we realised this would make it easier to change to the next question. 
		        	We did this by stating that whenever the correct answer was chosen, it would move to the next question. If the 
		        	wrong answer was chosen, it would go to the fail screen and the player would have to restart the game. 
					Another difficulty we encountered was that the number of screens we wanted would make the game crash. We worked 
					around that by instead of changing screens, we changed the text in the textbox and buttons. This did make 
					the startup of the first question a little slower but in the end would make the game more enjoyable. This 
					also meant we could do the same for the branding screen. Instead of using a whole other screen for the branding 
					screen, we could work around that by instead changing the visibility of it to true at the startup and the screen1 
					visibility to false and vise versa for the player to actually be able to play the game. </p>
